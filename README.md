 Why do we use Git as a versioning tool?

Track Changes: Records every change in the project, helping revert to previous versions when needed.

Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same project without conflicts.

Branching and Merging: Allows developers to create isolated branches for features or fixes, then merge them back safely.

Backup and Recovery: Stores code on platforms like GitHub, making it easy to restore if data is lost locally.

Distributed System: Each clone has the full project history, so work can continue offline.

Handles Large Projects: Efficiently manages large codebases, ensuring fast operations and minimal storage needs.

Commit History: Provides a clear record of all changes, aiding transparency and debugging.

Tool Integration: Works well with IDEs and CI/CD pipelines, automating tests and deployments.

Conflict Resolution: Helps identify and resolve conflicts when merging changes.

Documentation: Tracks the projectâ€™s evolution, creating accountability and historical insight.
